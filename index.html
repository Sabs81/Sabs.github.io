New York City is currently involved in the construction of over 1000 locations for completely new schools, addition to existing schools, lease, and demolition, for a cost of more than $35 Billion at an average of $32 million per project. </p>

<p align="left">
According to data issued by New York Cityâ€™s School Construction Authority, they are currently involved in construction at 1078 locations for a cost of over $35 billion. 47% of that is for completely new schools to accommodate demographic shifts in the city. 44% is dedicated to additions to existing school buildings to make space for students. 8% will be used to lease existing buildings and then used as schools, and finally, 1% is dedicated to the cost of demolition of existing structures to make way for new projects.</p>

Nearly half of all new school construction projects are in Queens, where New York City is planning to spend 47% of all funds. Brooklyn will receive 24% of the funds. The Bronx is third at 16%. Staten Island will receive 8% and finally, Manhattan will only get 5%, which is not surprising as it is the most developed out of all the boroughs and practically has very little space for new people and their accompanying school needs. </p>

The School Construction Authority spends funds through other projects that are not included in this assessment.  </p>
